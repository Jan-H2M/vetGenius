# VetGenius.ai – Veterinary LLM Development Execution Plan

## Project Overview
VetGenius.ai aims to build a specialized multimodal large language model (LLM) as an assistant for veterinarians. 

### Key capabilities include:
- Text, speech, image, and lab/test result (blood analyses, biochemistry panels, etc.) inputs/outputs
- Comprehensive veterinary knowledge base (courses, reference literature, disease protocols)
- Heavy reliance on reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous improvement, especially in diagnostic reasoning, safety, and correctness
- Base model: gpt-oss-120B (as a starting point) model for pretraining / finetuning, to ensure strong reasoning and flexibility

## Technical Architecture

### Base Model
- Use gpt-oss-120B as the foundational model
- Pretrain or adapt as needed, then fine-tune using veterinary corpora, lab/test result data, multimodal data (images, speech)

### Structured Lab/Test Data Input Module
- Design schemas for lab/test results: parameter names, values, units, species, age, breed, weight, reference ranges, meta-data
- Normalize units, standardize naming
- Encode structured data so that model can use it meaningfully (e.g. via embedding structured inputs or keyed tokens)

### Knowledge Base / Graph RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Veterinary courses, literature, reference ranges, disease protocols
- Ability to retrieve relevant information given species, breed, lab values

### Multimodal Integration
- Speech-to-text / text-to-speech modules
- Image processing pipelines (diagnostic images: skin, x-ray, ultrasound, etc.)
- Combined input pipelines: case history + lab results + images + speech query

### Reinforcement Learning & Feedback Loop
- Collect feedback from veterinarians (in pilot / beta phases)
- Define reward models: correctness (diagnostic suggestion vs gold standard), safety, response clarity, correct lab result interpretation, low error / uncertainty
- Human-in-the-loop annotation & correction especially for lab/test misinterpretation or ambiguous cases

### Safety / Verification / Explainability Layer
- For ambiguous or borderline lab results, model should flag uncertainty
- Include "explanations" of how lab values contributed to suggestions
- Vet expert oversight for output, especially early in deployment

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- Scalable GPU/cloud setup for training, inference
- Low latency inference target (especially when lab data + multimodal inputs are included)
- Secure data handling, compliance, privacy (especially clinical data)

## Development Timeline

### Month 1 – Proof of Concept
**Deliverables:**
- Finalize base model adoption: set up gpt-oss-120B, infrastructure, compute resources
- Collect core veterinary textual corpora + sample lab/test result datasets; establish lab data schema (species, units, reference ranges)
- Build prototype model fine-tuned to interpret simple lab/test inputs: e.g. given species + blood panel, flag abnormal values, interpret for common veterinary conditions
- Test basic Q&A with text + lab results. Aim for >80% accuracy on initial test set

### Month 2 – Alpha Version
**Deliverables:**
- Integrate Graph RAG / knowledge base; expand content to include disease protocols, literature + reference ranges
- Integrate speech-to-text and text-to-speech interfaces
- Build UI / API pipelines for uploading / inputting lab/test results. Ensure unit normalization, data validation in UI
- Internal testing: lab data part tested for correctness of interpretation, response latencies, edge cases (abnormal lab values, missing fields)
- Collect initial feedback from a few veterinarians on lab result workflows

### Month 3 – Beta Development
**Deliverables:**
- Multimodal workflows: image + lab/test + case history + speech + text. Example: vet uploads image + blood panel + patient info, model gives diagnostic suggestions
- Reinforcement learning: set up feedback loops, reward models, collect vet responses; perform RL fine-tuning
- Expand the knowledge base further (species / breed specific norms, uncommon conditions)
- Beta test with veterinary practices; focus particularly on lab test interpretation, error cases, safety

### Month 4 – Production Release
**Deliverables:**
- Full production-ready model: all modalities + lab/test integration + RL-refined diagnostic assistant
- Deploy user interface for production use by pilot clinics. Ensure pipelines are robust, latency acceptable
- Safety & error handling in place: uncertainty flags, explainability, vet validation
- Monitor and measure: vet satisfaction, diagnostic accuracy, lab test interpretation error rates, latency. Prepare for scaling

## Success Metrics

### Month 1:
- Prototype can interpret basic lab/test result inputs with >80% correctness on test cases
- Able to distinguish normal vs abnormal values for common panels

### Month 2:
- Speech integration works, lab data pipelines functional, unit normalization and validation in UI
- Response latency acceptable (<2-3 seconds) when lab data included

### Month 3:
- Multimodal workflows produce diagnostic suggestions that align well with veterinarian judgments
- RL feedback loop shows improvement in safety / correctness metrics

### Month 4:
- Production deployment with pilot clinics
- Low error rate on misinterpretation of lab data
- High vet satisfaction; stable latency; safe & explainable outputs
